"Define an expl3 (LaTeX3) macro `\\makekvtable` that takes a comma-separated list of key=value pairs and generates a two-column tabular of keys and values; include a one-line example that compiles."
"Write a robust TeX macro `\\boldcaps{}` (plain LaTeX2e, no external packages required) that uppercases and bolds its argument reliably for short phrases and show a one-line demo that compiles."
"Implement a macro `\\drule{len}{label}` that draws a decorative horizontal rule whose length is computed from `len` (a numeric width) using TikZ math; include a minimal example showing a 3cm rule labeled 'R'."
"Create a macro `\\chem{}` that typesets chemical formulas with proper subscripts and optional charge (e.g., `H2O`, `SO4^{2-}`) using pure LaTeX token processing; include three short example usages so the document compiles."
"Define a macro that sets up a theorem-like environment `mythm` with italic body and automatic numbering, and include one example theorem invocation so the document compiles."
"Provide a tiny `tikz-cd` macro `\\twomap{A}{B}{f}{g}` that draws a simple two-arrow diagram A \\u2192\\u2192 B with labels f and g; include one-line usage that compiles (assume tikz-cd loaded)."
"Implement a macro `\\boxedalign` that wraps a small `align` environment in a visible box and preserves equation numbers; include a demo with two aligned equations that compiles (use amsmath)."
"Write a concise macro `\\mkcounter{cmd}` which defines a new counter and a command `\\cmd` that increments and prints it; provide example definitions for `\\ex` and one usage so it compiles."
"Create a small macro `\\highlightdiag{matrix}` that takes a 3x3 matrix and colors its diagonal entries using TikZ overlay; include one example matrix so compilation succeeds."
"Provide a macro `\\timeline{(label,date),(label,date),...}` that draws a short horizontal timeline with three labeled tick marks using TikZ; include an example usage with three events so the document compiles."
"Implement a compact macro `\\evalexpr{<tex-num-expr>}` that evaluates a simple integer expression using TeX \\\\numexpr (supports +,-,*,/) and prints the result; include usage examples like `\\evalexpr{(3+4)*2}` so the document compiles."
"Write a small macro `\\autorefsec{title}` that creates a labeled section and a one-line reference to it later, demonstrating that the label/ref resolve in a single run (use \\\\label/\\ref); include both the section and the referring line so the sample compiles."
"Define a macro `\\fcolorboxtext{color}{text}` that draws a framed colored box around `text` with controlled padding (no external styling packages beyond xcolor/graphicx); include a one-line demonstration that compiles."
"Provide a compact `expl3`-style token list processor macro which counts the number of comma-separated items in an input list and prints the count; include a one-line example `count=3` so the code compiles."
"Create a short macro `\\subfigplaceholders{left-caption}{right-caption}` that places two placeholder boxes side-by-side with independent captions (no external image files), and include one usage so it compiles."
